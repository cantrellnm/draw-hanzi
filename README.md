# Draw Hanzi

An application to practice drawing Chinese hanzi characters. You can practice using existing lists of radicals or vocabulary, or sign up to add your own custom lists to work through.

This app was hacked together in a short period of time so that I could start using it. Not very sophisticated, and I couldn't have done it at all without the wonderful work of the following open source projects:

- [chanind/hanzi-writer](href='https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer')
- [niedlr/hanzi](href='https://github.com/nieldlr/hanzi')
- [quizlet/pinyin-converter](href='https://github.com/quizlet/pinyin-converter')
- [tom-s/speak-tts](href='https://github.com/tom-s/speak-tts')

(And all the other software and packages available and necessary for creating a web application, of which there are many.)

Pull requests are welcome if you are a developer, or feel free to open an issue if you run into problems using the app.
